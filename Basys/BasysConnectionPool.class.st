I implement a thread safe pool of BasysConnection's for given BasysRemotePeer instance. 
Users should allocate connection, do the job and release it back: 

	connection := pool allocateConnection.
	pool releaseConnection: connection 

There is a suitable method to ensure that release is performed at the end:

	pool allocateConnectionFor: [ :connection |  ]

Users add new connections using: 

	pool addConnection: aConnection 
	
Remote peer restricts a number of connections which pool is allowed to have:

	remotePeer maxConnections 
	
I raise a BasysTooManyConnections error when user adds too many connections. Method #allowNewConnection performs the required checks.

When all connections in the pool are busy the allocation request will wait next free connection.

Both #addConnection: and #allocateConnection operations clean invalid connections detected in the pool:
	
	pool cleanInvalidConnections
	
It can be connections closed from remote side or broken by any other reason (from debugger for example).
In addition the allocation logic is built with a loop to periodically check the connectivity to avoid the corner case when all busy connections silently become invalid while allocation was in a waiting state (see #connectivityPollingRate).

My subclases add specific features depending on connectivity status of remote peer instance (which they belong to): 

- active pool is able to establish new connections by demand when no free connection is available.
When all connections are busy the active pool establishes a new one (until it is allowed)

- passive pool fails allocation immediately when no connections exist in the pool.
It's unable to open connection by itself and therefore there is no reason to wait anything. It raises BasysConnectionDoesNotExist error.

There are several methods to test a type of pool:

- isActive
- isPassive
- isClosed

I implement converting methods to change the type of live pool instance:

- bePassive 
- beActive  

They use a change class primitive as very simple approach which does not require to create a new instance of new type.

Another method #close converts the pool to the BasysClosedConnectionPool class. It was introduced as hardcore approach to block any communication with remote side forever. Closed pool simply fails any operation with BasysRemotePeerClosed error. 

At first step the #close cleans the pool (using #clean method). It closes all connection (#close) and removes them from the pool. At the end pool becomes empty.

To check the size of the pool use following methods: 

- #isEmpty 
- #size  

To create pool instances use following example: 

	BasysActiveConnectionPool of: aRemotePeer 

Pool is created internaly by remote peer and it is not supposed to be used outside of it.
